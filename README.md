# The Citation File Format project

In this repository, the Steering Committee of the Citation File Format project maintains documents regarding the governance of the project.

The governance of the Citation File Format project is described in the [governance document](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Aims

The Citation File Format makes it easier for research software engineers
and researchers to make their software citable, and for their users to
cite it.

We do this by

-   maintaining and further developing a schema for a **file format for software citation metadata** that is writable and readable by humans and machines;
-   creating **tooling**, and technical **infrastructure** that lower the barriers to working with software citation metadata;
-   working with software citation experts, open source developers, research software engineers and metadata projects and their users to ensure that our outputs are **usable and useful**, and meet their requirements;
-   creating a welcoming and inclusive **community**, where we work equitably and are valued, to help each other and achieve our goals; and
-   **advocating** for and **enabling** better software citation practice.

This work is important because, when software is cited, 1) research
software becomes part of the scholarly record, and 2) the people that
create the software receive credit for their work. Citing software also
creates provenance for research and enables reproducibility.

## Scope

The Citation File Format project primarily focuses on **citation**
metadata for **software**.

## Code of Conduct

The Citation File Format project has adopted a [Code of Conduct (CoC)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
also available on the Code of Conduct page on the project website. This CoC
is binding for the Citation File Format project and all of its
subprojects. Subprojects can delegate the handling of CoC violations to
the CoC Committee of the Citation File Format project, or form their own
CoC committees. The Citation File Format project CoC Committee must be
informed when subprojects form their own CoC committees.
